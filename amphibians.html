                <li><p><b>Moist, smooth skin:</b> Amphibians can breathe through their skin, so they need to stay moist to exchange gasses.</p></li>

                <h2><li>Frogs</li></h2>
                <p>Frogs and toads are the most common amphibians, and can be found in lakes, rivers, and streams. They have squat, bulbous bodies, bulging eyes, and strong hind legs that allow them to leap. Frogs are distinguished by their lack of tails.Frogs vary widely in size and weight depending on species. For example, the West African goliath frog can grow to 15 inches and weigh as much as 7 pounds. Meanwhile, the Cuban tree frog grows to only half an inch and weighs approximately 2 ounces.</p>

                <h2><li>Toads</li></h2>
                <p>Like frogs, toads are amphibians. They differ from most frogs because they have dry skin, warts, crests behind the eyes, and parotoid glands. The parotoid glands produce a poisonous secretion that helps the toad defend itself from predators. This substance, called a bufotoxin, can cause death in small animals and allergic reactions in humans. Toads have other ways to avoid being eaten too. If they’re brown or green in color, they can blend into their surroundings and escape detection. If brightly colored, they warn predators to stay away because they’re poisonous.</p>

                <h2><li>Salamanders</li></h2>
                <p>Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order Urodela from the group Caudata.Salamander diversity is highest in eastern North America, especially in the Appalachian Mountains; most species are found in the Holarctic realm, with some species present in the Neotropical realm.</p>

                <h2><li>Newts</li></h2>
                <p>Newts are amphibians, which are vertebrates that can live both on land and in water. They are a type of salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, and their scientific name is Pleurodelinae. Newts are semiaquatic, meaning they spend time in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.Newts have thin, damp skin, no scales, and move more slowly than lizards, which are reptiles. They are sometimes confused with lizards, but lizards do not breed in water.</p>

                <h2><li>Caecilians</li></h2>
                <p>Caecilians are a group of limbless amphibians that are long-bodied and look like earthworms due to the segmental rings around their bodies. They are also known as burrowing amphibians and have small or sometimes nonexistent eyes. Caecilians are among the least familiar amphibians because they mostly live hidden in soil or in streambeds.Caecilians are the first amphibians shown to pass microbes to their offspring. Mothers produce a special layer of fatty skin tissue, which juvenile caecilians tear off with baby teeth that evolved specifically for this purpose.</p>
