            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Here are some characteristics of Birds</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Feathers:</b>  Birds are the only animals with feathers, which are unique to this class. Feathers provide insulation, enable flight, and often serve as display structures for courtship rituals.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Bipedalism:</b>  Birds are warm-blooded animals, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Hollow Bones:</b> Birds have lightweight skeletons with hollow bones, which reduce their overall body weight, making flight easier. This adaptation is crucial for powered flight.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Beaks and Bills:</b> Instead of teeth, birds have beaks or bills, which vary widely in shape, size, and function depending on the bird's diet and habitat.</p></li>

                <h2><li>Passerines (Perching Birds)</li></h2>
                <p>Passerines, also known as perching birds, are a group of birds in the order Passeriformes that make up more than half of all bird species. The word passerine comes from the Latin word passer, which means sparrow. Passerines are characterized by their anisodactyl toe arrangement, which has three toes facing forward and two facing backward, all meeting the foot at the same level. This arrangement helps them perch on tree branches.

                <h2><li>Birds of Prey (Raptors)</li></h2>
                <p>Birds of prey, also known as raptors, are carnivorous birds that hunt other animals for food. They have sharp eyesight, hooked beaks, and sharp talons to help them detect and catch prey. The word "raptor" comes from the Latin word raptare, which means "to seize and carry off".Bird of prey, any bird that pursues other animals for food; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). Birds of prey are classified in two orders: Falconiformes and Strigiformes. All birds of prey have hook-tipped beaks and sharp curved claws called talons (in nonpredatory vultures the talons are present but atrophied).</p>

                <h2><li>Waterfowl</li></h2>
                <p>Waterfowl is a term for birds that are often found near water, especially swimming game birds like ducks and geese. They are strong swimmers with webbed feet and waterproof feathers that they use like flippers to move through the water. Waterfowl can be found on every continent except Antarctica, and live in a variety of habitats, including the tropics, the high Arctic, and the ocean.</p>

                <h2><li>Game Birds</li></h2>
                <p>As the name implies, game birds are birds that are hunted in the wild, as well as kept in captivity where they are raised, often with some difficulty. They include guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, squabs, and quail. Except for quail, they are seasonal breeders, so the product is not available fresh all year round. None are indigenous to Australia.
                    Partridge, although grown in small numbers, have not been included here, as it is not possible to get accurate information on numbers or farms. One Victorian breeder raises 2000 partridges each year for shoots. </p>

                <h2><li>Wading Birds</li></h2>
                <p>Wading birds are a diverse group of birds including herons, egrets, bitterns, ibises, coots, moorhens, rails, and sandhill cranes. The herons and egrets are large, long-legged, long-necked species that are typically seen wading in shallow water while searching for food. Bitterns, rails, and moorhens are smaller secretive species that hide amongst marsh vegetation and are typically only heard rather than seen. All of these species depend on healthy wetland complexes and often the surrounding uplands for breeding, feeding, and during migration.</p>
