            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Vertebrates:</b> Fish are vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone or spinal column running along their dorsal side</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Aquatic Habitat:</b> Fish are primarily aquatic animals, rivers, lakes, streams, and even in underground caves.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Fins for Movement:</b>: Fish have fins that they use for propulsion, stability, and maneuvering in the water. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Wide Diversity:</b> There are over 34,000 known species of fish, making them the most diverse group of vertebrates. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Cold-blooded: </b> Fish are ectothermic or cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is regulated by the surrounding environment. </p></li>

                <h2><li>Freshwater Fish</li></h2>
                <p>Freshwater fish are fish species that spend some or all of their lives in bodies of fresh water such as rivers, lakes and inland wetlands, where the salinity is less than 1.05%. These environments differ from marine habitats in many ways, especially the difference in levels of osmolarity. To survive in fresh water, fish need a range of physiological adaptations.41.24% of all known species of fish are found in fresh water. This is primarily due to the rapid speciation that the scattered habitats make possible. </p>

                <h2><li>Saltwater Fish:</li></h2>
                <p>Saltwater fish are very commonly kept in aquariums for entertainment. Many saltwater fish are also caught to be eaten, or grown in aquaculture. However, many fish species have been overfished and are otherwise threatened by marine pollution or ecological changes caused by climate change.Fishes that live in the ocean can be carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores.[4] Herbivores in the ocean eat things such as algae and flowering seagrasses. Many herbivores' diets consist of primarily algae. Most saltwater fish will eat both macroalgae and microalgae. Many fish eat red, green, brown, and blue algae, but some fish prefer certain types.</p>

                <h2><li>Deep-Sea Fish</li></h2>
                <p>Deep-sea fish are fish that live in the darkness below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the epipelagic or photic zone of the sea. The lanternfish is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish. Other deep-sea fishes include the flashlight fish, cookiecutter shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and some species of eelpout.It has been speculated that deep-sea ecosystems may have been inhospitable to vertebrate life prior to an increased influx of nutrients into the ocean during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous following the rise of angiosperms on land, which led to an increase in abyssal invertebrate life, allowing fish to in turn colonize these ecosystems. </p>

                <h2><li>Tropical Fish</li></h2>
                <p>Tropical fish is a term commonly used to refer to fish that are kept in heated aquariums. Freshwater tropical fish are more commonly kept than saltwater tropical fish due to the common availability of fresh water sources, such as tap water, whereas salt water is not commonly available and has to be recreated by using fresh water with sea salt additions. Salt water has to be monitored to maintain the correct salinity because of the effects of evaporation. Freshwater tropical aquariums can be maintained by simply topping up with fresh water. </p>

                <h2><li>Anadromous Fish:</li></h2>
                <p>Anadromous fishes are those that spawn in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to forage and mature, and return to freshwater to spawn and begin the cycle again. As anadromous species, the salmonids pass through multiple habitat transitions and face major physiological challenges the most critical adaptation for this lifestyle is the ability to osmoregulate in both freshwater and marine environments, and to do so at precisely prescribed times. The evolution of anadromy has intrigued biologists for as long as salmon have been studied. Although many theories have been put forth to explain the evolution of anadromy, such a major life history character must, on balance, provide an overall advantage to individual fish. </p>
