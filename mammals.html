            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Hair or Fur:</b> Mammals are characterized by having hair or fur covering their bodies at some point in their life cycle.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Warm-Blooded:</b> Mammals are endothermic or warm-blooded, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Mammary Glands:</b>All mammals possess mammary glands, which produce milk to nourish their young. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Live Birth:</b> Most mammals give birth to live young, although there are exceptions such as monotremes that lay eggs. </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Parental Care: </b>  Mammals often exhibit parental care, with adults providing food, protection, and teaching to their offspring.  </p></li>

                <h2><li>Primates</li></h2>
                <p>Primates are the members of a diverse order of mammals. They are divided into the strepsirrhines, which include the lemurs, galagos, and lorisids, and the haplorhines, which include the tarsiers and the simians (monkeys and apes). Primates arose 85–55 million years ago first from small terrestrial mammals, which adapted to living in the trees of tropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, including large brains, visual acuity, color vision, a shoulder girdle allowing a large degree of movement in the shoulder joint, and dexterous hands.</p>

                <p>Cetaceans are marine mammals that include whales, dolphins, and porpoises. They are fully aquatic, meaning they spend their entire lives in the ocean and cannot survive on land. Cetaceans are characterized by their streamlined body shape, large size, and carnivorous diet. They have two front flippers and tails shaped into two horizontal extensions called flukes, which provide them with great swimming powe</p>

                <h2><li>Rodents</li></h2>
                <p>Rodents are mammals in the order Rodentia, which make up the largest order of mammals, with over 2,000 species and 440 genera. They are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each jaw, and are easily distinguished from other mammals by their teeth. The word "rodent" comes from the Greek word roder, which means to gnaw.Rodents are well adapted to a wide range of habitats and are found almost worldwide, with the exception of Antarctica and some islands. They include rats, squirrels, porcupines, mice, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs.</p>

                <h2><li>Bats</li></h2>
                <p>Bats are mammals that are the only ones capable of true flight. They have wings that are similar in bone structure to human hands, with flaps of skin between the bones. Bats are nocturnal, and are active at night, dusk, or dawn. They are found all over the world, except for the Arctic, Antarctic, and some oceanic islands.While the flying squirrel can only glide for short distances, bats are true fliers. A bat’s wing resembles a modified human hand — imagine the skin between your fingers larger, thinner and stretched. This flexible skin membrane that extends between each long finger bone and many movable joints make bats agile fliers. </p>

                <h2><li>Caecilians</li></h2>
                <p>Caecilians are a group of limbless amphibians that are long-bodied and look like earthworms due to the segmental rings around their bodies. They are also known as burrowing amphibians and have small or sometimes nonexistent eyes. Caecilians are among the least familiar amphibians because they mostly live hidden in soil or in streambeds.Caecilians are the first amphibians shown to pass microbes to their offspring. Mothers produce a special layer of fatty skin tissue, which juvenile caecilians tear off with baby teeth that evolved specifically for this purpose.</p>
