            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Ectothermic:</b> Reptiles are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Dry, Scaly Skin: </b> These scales help to reduce water loss through the skin and provide protection from abrasion, injury, and pathogens.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Amniotic Eggs:</b>   Reptiles lay eggs covered by a protective shell, known as amniotic eggs.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Diverse Diet:</b>Reptiles exhibit a diverse range of dietary habits, including carnivory, herbivory, and omnivory.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Three-Chambered Heart: </b>Reptiles have a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle.</p></li>

                <h2><li>Lizards</li></h2>
                <p>Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes (and to a lesser extent amphisbaenians), encompassing over 7,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The grouping is paraphyletic as some lizards are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.</p>

                <h2><li>Snakes</li></h2>
                <p>Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes (/sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/).[2] Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.</p>

                <h2><li>Turtles and Tortoises</li></h2>
                <p>Turtles and tortoises are both reptiles that belong to the order Testudines, and there are over 350 species of both. The main difference between turtles and tortoises is where they live: tortoises are exclusively land creatures, while turtles spend most of their time in or near water. Tortoises have more rounded and domed shells, while turtles have thinner, more streamlined shells that aid in swimming.</p>

                <h2><li>Crocodilians</li></h2>
                <p>Crocodilians are a group of large, predatory, semi-aquatic reptiles that includes crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials. They are characterized by their long bodies and tails, relatively short legs, long, teeth-filled snouts, and powerful jaws. Crocodilians are the closest living relatives of birds and are highly efficient predators that tend to be top of the food chain in their watery environments.</p>

                <h2><li>Chameleons</li></h2>
                <p>Chameleons are reptiles that can change color, have long sticky tongues, and independently moving eyes. They are carnivorous and live in Africa, Asia, and Europe, but most live in Madagascar and Africa. Chameleons can range in size from a thumbnail to a house cat.Chameleons are known for their ability to change color to attract mates, regulate body temperature, or tell intruders to stay away. They usually present as green or brown to blend into their arboreal habitat. When a chameleon does change color, it's usually to stand out.</p>
